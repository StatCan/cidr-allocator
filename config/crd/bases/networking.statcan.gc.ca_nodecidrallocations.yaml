          This is a CRD that defines a NodeCIDRAllocation resource which allows for the allocation of PodCIDRs / Pod Subnets to Kubernetes Nodes
          to be assigned to nodes in a cluster. This is implemented using a list of network CIDRs as blocks of available address space that can be allocated
          to nodes using a node selector to filter the nodes upon which to apply the Pod CIDRs.

                  NOTE: Nodes that are selected through the node selector MUST specify a maximum number of pods in order to help identify
                        the correct size for the NodeCIDRAllocation Controller to allocate to it. If none is specified a subnet WILL NOT be allocated for the Node.
