        description: This is a CRD that defines a NodeCIDRAllocation resource which
          allows for the allocation of node pod ranges to be assigned to nodes in
          a cluster. This is implemented using a list of network CIDRs as blocks of
          available address space that can be allocated to nodes using a node selector
          to filter the nodes upon which to apply the Pod CIDRs.
